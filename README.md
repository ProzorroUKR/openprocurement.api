```
cd docs
make gettext
```

2. Update translation with new/changed strings

```
cd docs
sphinx-intl update -p build/locale -l uk -w 0
```

3. Update updated/missing strings in `docs/source/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/*.po` with your-favorite-editor/poedit/transifex/pootle/etc. to have all translations complete/updated.

4. Compile the translation

```
cd docs
sphinx-intl build
```
