Options
=========

In addition to providing fields and their values in a request, you may also
specify options to control how your request is interpreted and how the
response is generated.  For GET requests, options are specified as URL
parameters prefixed with `opt_`.  For POST or PUT requests, options are
specified in the body, inside the top-level options object (a sibling of the
data object).  The option specified in the body overrides the `opt_` one
from URL parameter.

These options can be used in different combinations in a single request, though some of
them may conflict in their impact on the response.

:pretty:
  `?opt_pretty`

  `options: { pretty: true }` 

  | Provides the response in "pretty" output.  In case of JSON this means
    doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable.  This will
    take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable to use
    this only during debugging.
  |

:jsonp:
  `?opt_jsonp=myCallback`

  | Returns the output in JSON-P format instead of plain JSON. This allows
    requests to come from within browsers and work around the "same origin
    policy." The function named as the value of the `opt_jsonp` parameter will
    be called with a single argument, a JavaScript object representing the
    response.
  |

:fields:
  `?opt_fields=comma,separated,field,list`

  | List of extra fields to include in response.
  |

:schema:
  `?opt_schema=ocds`

  Returns the output as an `OCDS 1.1 schema <https://standard.open-contracting.org/schema/1__1__5/release-package-schema.json>`_ compatible structure
  See `their official site <https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/release_package/>`_.

  .. warning::
    The response may contain less data than the default response.
