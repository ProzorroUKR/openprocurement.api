msgid ""
"The Open Procurement API is the only interface to Open Procurement "
"database that is core unit of `Open Procurement "
"<http://openprocurement.org/>`_ infrastructure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Open Procurement API is a `REST "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer>`_-ful "
"interface that provides programmatic access to Tender database of Open "
"Procurement system.  It provides predictable URLs for accessing "
"resources, and uses built-in HTTP features to receive commands and return"
" responses. This makes it easy to communicate with."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The API accepts `JSON <http://json.org/>`_ or form-encoded content in "
"requests.  It returns JSON content in all of its responses, including "
"errors.  Only the UTF-8 character encoding is supported for both requests"
" and responses."
msgstr ""

msgid "Conventions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All API POST and PUT requests expect a top-level object with a single "
"element in it named `data`.  Successful responses will mirror this "
"format. The data element should itself be an object, containing the "
"parameters for the request.  In the case of creating a new tender, these "
"are the fields we want to set on the tender itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the request was successful, we will get a response code of `201` "
"indicating the object was created.  That response will have a data field "
"at its top level, which will contain complete information on the new "
"tender, including its ID."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If something went wrong during the request, we'll get a different status "
"code and the JSON returned will have an `errors` field at the top level "
"containing a list of problems.  We look at the first one and print out "
"its message."
