Tutorial
========

Exploring basic rules
---------------------

Let's try exploring the `/contracts` endpoint:

.. http:example:: http/contracts-listing-0.http
   :code:

Just invoking it reveals an empty set.

Contract is transferred from the tender system by an automated process.
The circumstances under which this happens are described below.


.. index:: Contracts

Creating contract
-----------------

Let's say that we have conducted tender with award. When the award is activated, a contract is **automatically** created in the tender with a limited set of fields(`id`, `awardID`, `status`, `date`, `value`) and in the contracting module with a full set of fields(:ref:`Econtract`) in ``pending`` status.

*Brokers (eMalls) can't create contracts in the contract system.*

A PQ contract is created with two additional fields:

* `attributes` - formed from requirements and responses in tender
* `contractTemplateName` - copied from tender


Getting contract
----------------

Contract in the tender system

.. http:example:: http/example_contract.http
   :code:

*Contract id is the same in both tender and contract system.*

Let's access the URL of the created object:

.. http:example:: http/contract-view.http
   :code:


Getting access
--------------

**WARNING:**
Now that method is deprecated(later it will be deleted), you can use for all contract operation ``tender_token``.


In order to get rights for future contract editing, you need to use this view ``PATCH: /contracts/{id}/credentials?acc_token={tender_token}`` with the API key of the eMall (broker), where tender was generated.

In the ``PATCH: /contracts/{id}/credentials?acc_token={tender_token}``:

* ``id`` stands for contract id,

* ``tender_token`` is tender's token (is used for contract token generation).

Response will contain ``access.token`` for the contract that can be used for further contract modification.

.. http:example:: http/deprecated-contract-credentials.http
   :code:

Let's view contracts.

.. http:example:: http/contracts-listing-1.http
   :code:


We do see the internal `id` of a contract (that can be used to construct full URL by prepending `http://api-sandbox.openprocurement.org/api/0/contracts/`) and its `dateModified` datestamp.

Modifying pending contract
--------------------------

When contract in `pending` status buyer can update those fields:

* `title`
* `description`
* `status`
* `items`
* `value`
* `contractNumber`
* `dateSigned`
* `period`
* `implementation`


Setting contract value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default contract value is set based on the award, but there is a possibility to set custom contract value.

If you want to **lower contract value**, you can insert new one into the `amount` or `amountNet` field(for all procedures except esco).

.. http:example:: http/contract-set-contract-value.http
   :code:

`200 OK` response was returned. The value was modified successfully.

Setting value per item's unit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:example:: http/contract-set-contract_items_unit-value.http
   :code:

`200 OK` response was returned with successfully set item.unit.value structure.

Item.unit.value.currency and Item.unit.value.valueAddedTaxIncluded must correspond to the values of
contract.value.


Setting contract signature date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a possibility to set custom contract signature date. You can insert appropriate date into the `dateSigned` field.

If this date is not set, it will be auto-generated on the date of contract registration.

.. http:example:: http/contract-sign-date.http
   :code:

Setting contract validity period
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting contract validity period is optional, but if it is needed, you can set appropriate `startDate` and `endDate`.

.. http:example:: http/contract-period.http
   :code:

Uploading contract documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contract documents can be uploaded only to contract in `pending` and `active` statuses. Let's add contract document:

.. http:example:: http/contract-upload-document.http
   :code:

`201 Created` response code and `Location` header confirm that document has been added.

Let's see the list of contract documents:

.. http:example:: http/contract-get-documents.http
   :code:

We can add another contract document:

.. http:example:: http/contract-upload-second-document.http
   :code:

`201 Created` response code and `Location` header confirm second document has been added.

Let's see the list of all uploaded contract documents:

.. http:example:: http/contract-get-documents-again.http
   :code:


Cancelling contract
-------------------

There are two ways for cancelling contract:

* PATCH award status from `active` to `cancelled`
* PATCH contract status from "pending" to "cancelled" (this can only work if this contract is not the last active contract)


.. _econtracting_tutorial_cancelling_award:

Cancelling from award
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All you need, it's just patch award status to ``cancelled``

.. http:example:: http/award-cancelling.http
   :code:

Tender contract **automatically** turned to ``cancelled``

.. http:example:: http/tender-contract-cancelled.http
   :code:

Contract in contracting also **automatically** turned to ``cancelled``

.. http:example:: http/contract-cancelled.http
   :code:

Cancelling from contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If  you try to patch contract in ``pending`` to ``cancelled`` you'll get error:

.. http:example:: http/contract-cancelling-error.http
   :code:


Activating contract
-------------------

For activating contract, at first buyer and supplier should fill signer information.
If you try activate contract without that information you'll get error:

.. http:example:: http/contract-activating-error.http
   :code:

Buyer fill signer information using ``contract_token`` or ``tender_token``:

.. http:example:: http/contract-owner-add-signer-info.http
   :code:


Supplier fill signer information using ``bid_token``, for `limited` procedure that request, make buyer using ``contract_token`` or ``tender_token``:

.. http:example:: http/contract-supplier-add-signer-info.http
   :code:


You can update signer information using same method:

.. http:example:: http/update-contract-owner-add-signer-info.http
   :code:

If you try activate contract without required fields (`contractNumber`, `period.startDate`, etc.) you'll get error:

.. http:example:: http/contract-activating-error-fields.http
   :code:

After signer information and all required fields added you can activate contract:

.. http:example:: http/contract-activate.http
   :code:


After activating contract, tender contract **automatically** switch to `active` and tender  to `complete`:

.. http:example:: http/tender-complete.http
   :code:


Modifying active contract
-------------------------

You can make changes to the contract in cases described in the 4th part of Article 36 of the Law "On the Public Procurement".

**Essential contract terms** can be modified by the submission of a new :ref:`change` object to the `Contract.changes` container.

All `changes` are processed by the endpoint `/contracts/{id}/changes`.

Submitting a change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's add new `change` to the contract:

.. http:example:: http/add-contract-change.http
   :code:

Note that you can provide more than one value in ``rationaleTypes`` field.

You can view the `change`:

.. http:example:: http/view-contract-change.http
   :code:

`Change` can be modified while it is in the ``pending`` status:

.. http:example:: http/patch-contract-change.http
   :code:

Uploading change document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Document can be added only while `change` is in the ``pending`` status.

Document has to be added in two stages:

* you should upload document

.. http:example:: http/add-contract-change-document.http
   :code:

* you should set document properties ``"documentOf": "change"`` and ``"relatedItem": "{change.id}"`` in order to bind the uploaded document to the `change`:

.. http:example:: http/set-document-of-change.http
   :code:

Updating contract properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you can update contract properties which belong to the change.

You can update value `amount` and `amountNet` following next rules:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - `valueAddedTaxIncluded`
     - `Validation`
   * - true
     - Amount should be greater than amountNet and differ by no more than 20%

       (but Amount and amountNet can be equal)
   * - false
     - Amount and amountNet should be equal


.. http:example:: http/contracts-patch.http
   :code:

We see the added properties have merged with existing contract data. Additionally, the `dateModified` property was updated to reflect the last modification datestamp.

Fields that can be modified: `title`, `description`, `status`, `value.amount`, `value.amountNet`, `period`, `items`, `amountPaid.amount`, `amountPaid.amountNet`, `terminationDetails`.

See examples of `items` customization below. You can:

* update item:

.. http:example:: http/update-contract-item.http
   :code:

Applying the change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Change` can be applied by switching to the ``active`` status.

In order to apply ``active`` status `dateSigned` field must be set.

After this `change` can't be modified anymore.

.. http:example:: http/apply-contract-change.http
   :code:

`dateSigned` field validation:

* for the first contract `change` date should be after `contract.dateSigned`;

* for all next `change` objects date should be after the previous `change.dateSigned`.

You can view all changes:

.. http:example:: http/view-all-contract-changes.http
   :code:

All changes are also listed on the contract view.

.. http:example:: http/view-contract.http
   :code:


Uploading documentation
-----------------------

Procuring entity can upload PDF files into the created contract. Uploading should
follow the :ref:`upload` rules.

.. http:example:: http/upload-contract-document.http
   :code:

`201 Created` response code and `Location` header confirm document creation.
We can additionally query the `documents` collection API endpoint to confirm the
action:

.. http:example:: http/contract-documents.http
   :code:

And again we can confirm that there are two documents uploaded.

.. http:example:: http/upload-contract-document-2.http
   :code:

In case we made an error, we can reupload the document over the older version:

.. http:example:: http/upload-contract-document-3.http
   :code:

And we can see that it is overriding the original version:

.. http:example:: http/get-contract-document-3.http
   :code:


.. index:: Enquiries, Question, Answer


Completing contract
-------------------

Before contract can be completed ``amountPaid`` field value should be set (regardless whether the contract was successful or unsuccessful).
Contract can be completed by switching to ``terminated`` status.
Let's perform these actions in single request:

.. http:example:: http/contract-termination.http
   :code:

Note that you can set/change ``amountPaid.amount``, ``amountPaid.amountNet``, ``amountPaid.valueAddedTaxIncluded`` values. ``amountPaid.currency`` field value is generated from ``Contract.value`` field.

If contract is unsuccessful reasons for termination ``terminationDetails`` should be specified.

Any future modification to the contract are not allowed.


.. index:: Aggregate contracts

Aggregate contracts
===================

Creation of aggregate contracts
-------------------------------

For each `buyer` object in tender system is creating separate `contract` respectively when `award` become active.

Create tender with several buyers, each `item` should be assigned to related `buyer` using `relatedBuyer` field :

.. http:example:: http/create-multiple-buyers-tender.http
    :code:

Move forward as usual, activate award:

.. http:example:: http/set-active-award.http
    :code:

After activating award system is creating such amount of contracts that corresponds to the amount of buyers

.. http:example:: http/get-multi-contracts.http
    :code:

Update Amount.Value of each contract considering the sum of product of Unit.Value by Quantity for each item in contract.

.. http:example:: http/patch-1st-contract-value.http
    :code:

.. http:example:: http/patch-2nd-contract-value.http
    :code:

You can activate or terminate each contract as usual.
If there are not contracts in `pending` status and at least one contract became `active` tender is becoming `complete`

If award was cancelled, all contracts related to this awardID become in cancelled status.


Cancellation of aggregate contracts
-----------------------------------

Contracts can be cancelled:

.. http:example:: http/patch-to-cancelled-1st-contract.http
    :code:

Except when contract is the last not cancelled contract:

.. http:example:: http/patch-to-cancelled-2nd-contract-error.http
    :code:

In that case related award should be cancelled:

.. http:example:: http/award-cancelling.http
    :code:

Let's check all contracts are cancelled:

.. http:example:: http/get-multi-contracts-cancelled.http
    :code:
