Multiple Lots Tutorial
======================


Creating tender
---------------

Let's create tender:

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/tender-post-attempt-json-data.http
   :code:

Now we can see that new object was created. Response code is `201`
and `Location` response header reports the location of the created object.  The
body of response reveals the information about the created tender: its internal
`id` (that matches the `Location` segment), its official `tenderID` and
`dateModified` datestamp stating the moment in time when tender was last
modified.  Note that tender is created with `active.tendering` status.

The peculiarity of the Open EU procedure is that ``procurementMethodType`` was changed from ``belowThreshold`` to ``aboveThresholdEU``.
Also there is no opportunity to set up ``enquiryPeriod``, it will be assigned automatically.

Tender can contain several different lots. We can add lot using the following way:

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/tender-add-lot.http
   :code:

Also you will need to update data about item's related lots:

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/tender-add-relatedLot-to-item.http
   :code:

View tender listing:

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/tender-listing-no-auth.http
   :code:

or view tender:

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/tender-view.http
   :code:



Registering bid
---------------

Tender status ``active.tendering`` allows registration of bids.

Bidder can register a bid for lot №1:

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/bid-lot1.http
   :code:

Bidder can register bids for all lots:

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/bid-lot2.http
   :code:

Then bidder should upload technical and private documents of proposal.

We can update tender during ``active.tendering`` period. Bids will be invalid after updating tender. For example, let's reduce the lot price to 400.

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/tender-invalid-all-bids.http
   :code:

Here is the bidder's proposal after tender was updated.

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/bid-lot1-invalid-view.http
   :code:

Firstly bidder has to renew bid, even if he was placing a bid just for a lot №1.

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/bid-lot1-update-view.http
   :code:

Then bidder has to renew bid only for a lot №1.

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/bid-lot2-update-view.http
   :code:


Bid Qualification
-----------------

Open EU procedure requires bid's value qualification.

Let's view tender: 

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/tender-view-pre-qualification.http
   :code:

Let's list qualifications:

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/qualifications-view.http
   :code:

Approve bid's value through qualification objects:

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/tender-activate-qualifications.http
   :code:


Procuring entity approves qualifications by switching to next status:

.. include:: http/multiple_lots_tutorial/tender-view-pre-qualification-stand-still.http
   :code:

There is 10 day stand-still period set in `qualificationPeriod`.
