Bid Items
=========

Items in bid are available in all types of procedures


Creating bid with items
-----------------------

To create a bid with a procurement item, you need to pass the `items` field with a value containing a list of :ref:`BidItem` .

If you try to pass an item with an id that does not exist in tender.items, you will get an error:

.. http:example:: http/bid-items-localization/unsuccessful-create-bid-with-items.http
   :code:


Let's send correct data:

.. http:example:: http/bid-items-localization/successfuly-create-bid-with-items.http
   :code:


Update bid items
----------------

You can update `quantity` and `unit` in bid items.

To update the data in items, you need to pass all elements from the list along with all data; otherwise, the data that is not passed will be lost:
