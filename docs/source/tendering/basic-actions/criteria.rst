Exclusion criteria available only on: aboveThresholdUA, aboveThresholdEU, competitiveDialogueUA,
competitiveDialogueEU, competitiveDialogueUA.stage2, competitiveDialogueEU.stage2, esco, closeFrameworkAgreementUA

Standard data, you could get `here <https://github.com/ProzorroUKR/standards/pull/79/files>`__

You can't update tender to status `active.tendering` without 9 EXCLUSION criteria:

.. include:: ../http/criteria/update-tender-status-without-criteria.http

EXCLUSION criteria and all criteria objects are not updated:

You can patch exclusion requirement, but you can send only `eligibleEvidences`
