"In order to use acceleration mode you should set `quick, "
"accelerator=1440` as text value for `procurementMethodDetails` during "
"tender creation. The number 1440 shows that restrictions and time frames "
"will be reduced in 1440 times. For example, `complaintPeriod` for the "
"Negotiation procedure should be at least 10 days. When using the "
"acceleration mode with `1440` value, tenderingPeriod can be as short as "
"10 minutes (10 days = 14400 min; 14400/1440 = 10 min). This mode will "
"work only in the **sandbox**."
