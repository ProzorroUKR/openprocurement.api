msgid "In previous flow after creation Procuring Entity published procedure by changing status to `draft.publishing` where **priceQuotationBot** robot ran validation of the procedure and supplemented procedure with additional data taken from ProZorro e-Catalogues database including `shortListedFirms`."
msgstr ""

msgid "After successful validation priceQuotationBot transmitted procedure to status: `active.tendering` or `draft.unsuccessful` in case if procedure did not pass validation due to invalid options."
